<h1>Would you like to embed this on your site?</h1>

<p>To embed this on your site, copy this code and inset as HTML:</p>

<div>
  <code>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://contactmps.openup.org.za/static/javascript/embed.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </code>
</div>
<br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/javascript/embed.js"></script>
